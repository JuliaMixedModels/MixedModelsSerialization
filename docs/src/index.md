*MixedModelsSerialization.jl* is a Julia package providing some extra serialization and memory-saving (at the cost of some functionality) capabilities for models fit with [MixedModels.jl](https://juliastats.org/MixedModels.jl/stable/).
It is a proving ground for new ideas so that breaking releases can be made independently of MixedModels.jl.
